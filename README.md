# Hi! I'm Nate ðŸ˜„
Like most other people on this site, I'm a software developer interested in contributing to the world of open source software. 
I believe software should be open and free, and I'm always available to help out with any neat projects that push our world forward.
## What I do
Right now, I'm
- studying Computer Science at [Illinois State University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/illinois-state-university/)
- Developing Azure cloud-based solutions as a Full-Stack developer at Complete Weddings and Events
- and of course, working on open source projects!

Outside of tech, I'm also studying Philosophy, am involved in student advocacy and governance at my university, and just
generally am always seeking out connections with intersting people and exciting opportunites I can dive into.
